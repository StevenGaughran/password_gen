A lot of changes under the hood here:
    * Made the GUI its own class.
    * Created and reorganized functions to clean everything up.
    * A new window now pops up when you create your password. Fancy!
    * Created buttons which now restart or exit the program. The way I'm restarting the program probably isn't ideal, but it works.
    * Deleted a vestigial print function used for testing.
